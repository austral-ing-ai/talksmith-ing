This guide walks you through how to fine-tune Gemma on a custom text-to-sql dataset using Hugging Face [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) and [TRL](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/index). You will learn:

- What is Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) 
- Setup development environment 
- Create and prepare the fine-tuning dataset 
- Fine-tune Gemma using TRL and the SFTTrainer 
- Test Model Inference and generate SQL queries 

## What is Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA)

This guide demonstrates the use of [Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314), which emerged as a popular method to efficiently fine-tune LLMs as it reduces computational resource requirements while maintaining high performance. In QloRA, the pretrained model is quantized to 4-bit and the weights are frozen. Then trainable adapter layers (LoRA) are attached and only the adapter layers are trained. Afterwards, the adapter weights can be merged with the base model or kept as a separate adapter.

## Setup development environment

The first step is to install Hugging Face Libraries, including TRL, and datasets to fine-tune open model, including different RLHF and alignment techniques.

```
# Install Pytorch & other libraries
%pip install torch tensorboard
%pip install -U torchao

# Install Transformers
%pip install "transformers>=5.10.1"

# Install Hugging Face libraries
%pip install datasets accelerate evaluate bitsandbytes trl "peft>=0.19.0" protobuf sentencepiece

# COMMENT IN: if you are running on a GPU that supports BF16 data type and flash attn, such as NVIDIA L4 or NVIDIA A100
#%pip install flash-attn

```

*Note: If you are using a GPU with Ampere architecture (such as NVIDIA L4) or newer, you can use Flash attention. Flash Attention is a method that significantly speeds computations up and reduces memory usage from quadratic to linear in sequence length, leading to acelerating training up to 3x. Learn more at [FlashAttention](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/tree/main).*

You need a valid Hugging Face Token to publish your model. If you are running inside a Google Colab, you can securely use your Hugging Face Token using the Colab secrets otherwise you can set the token as directly in the `login` method. Make sure your token has write access too, as you push your model to the Hub during training.

```
# Login into Hugging Face Hub
from huggingface_hub import login
login()

```

## Create and prepare the fine-tuning dataset

When fine-tuning LLMs, it is important to know your use case and the task you want to solve. This helps you create a dataset to fine-tune your model. If you haven't defined your use case yet, you might want to go back to the drawing board.

As an example, this guide focuses on the following use case:

- Fine-tune a natural language to SQL model for seamless integration into a data analysis tool. The objective is to significantly reduce the time and expertise required for SQL query generation, enabling even non-technical users to extract meaningful insights from data. 

Text-to-SQL can be a good use case for fine-tuning LLMs, as it is a complex task that requires a lot of (internal) knowledge about the data and the SQL language.

Once you have determined that fine-tuning is the right solution, you need a dataset to fine-tune. The dataset should be a diverse set of demonstrations of the task(s) you want to solve. There are several ways to create such a dataset, including:

- Using existing open-source datasets, such as [Spider](https://huggingface.co/datasets/spider) 
- Using synthetic datasets created by LLMs, such as [Alpaca](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tatsu-lab/alpaca) 
- Using datasets created by humans, such as [Dolly](https://huggingface.co/datasets/databricks/databricks-dolly-15k). 
- Using a combination of the methods, such as [Orca](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Open-Orca/OpenOrca) 

Each of the methods has its own advantages and disadvantages and depends on the budget, time, and quality requirements. For example, using an existing dataset is the easiest but might not be tailored to your specific use case, while using domain experts might be the most accurate but can be time-consuming and expensive. It is also possible to combine several methods to create an instruction dataset, as shown in [Orca: Progressive Learning from Complex Explanation Traces of GPT-4.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02707)

This guide uses an already existing dataset ([philschmid/gretel-synthetic-text-to-sql](https://huggingface.co/datasets/philschmid/gretel-synthetic-text-to-sql)), a high quality synthetic Text-to-SQL dataset including natural language instructions, schema definitions, reasoning and the corresponding SQL query.

[Hugging Face TRL](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/en/index) supports automatic templating of conversation dataset formats. This means you only need to convert your dataset into the right json objects, and `trl` takes care of templating and putting it into the right format.

```
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are..."}, {"role": "user", "content": "..."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are..."}, {"role": "user", "content": "..."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are..."}, {"role": "user", "content": "..."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."}]}

```

The [philschmid/gretel-synthetic-text-to-sql](https://huggingface.co/datasets/philschmid/gretel-synthetic-text-to-sql) contains over 100k samples. To keep the guide small, it is downsampled to only use 10,000 samples.

You can now use the Hugging Face Datasets library to load the dataset and create a prompt template to combine the natural language instruction, schema definition and add a system message for your assistant.

```
from datasets import load_dataset

# System message for the assistant
system_message = """You are a text to SQL query translator. Users will ask you questions in English and you will generate a SQL query based on the provided SCHEMA."""

# User prompt that combines the user query and the schema
user_prompt = """Given the <USER_QUERY> and the <SCHEMA>, generate the corresponding SQL command to retrieve the desired data, considering the query's syntax, semantics, and schema constraints.

<SCHEMA>
{context}
</SCHEMA>

<USER_QUERY>
{question}
</USER_QUERY>
"""
def create_conversation(sample, idx):
  return {
    "messages": [
      {"role": "system", "content": system_message},
      {"role": "user", "content": user_prompt.format(question=sample["sql_prompt"], context=sample["sql_context"])},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": sample["sql"]}
    ]
  }

# Load dataset from the hub
dataset = load_dataset("philschmid/gretel-synthetic-text-to-sql", split="train")
dataset = dataset.select(range(1250))

# Convert dataset to OAI messages
dataset = dataset.map(create_conversation, with_indices=True, remove_columns=dataset.features)
# split dataset into 80% training samples and 20% test samples
dataset = dataset.train_test_split(test_size=0.2, shuffle=False)

# Print formatted user prompt
for item in dataset["train"][0]["messages"]:
  print(item)

```

```

{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a text to SQL query translator. Users will ask you questions in English and you will generate a SQL query based on the provided SCHEMA.'}
{'role': 'user', 'content': "Given the <USER_QUERY> and the <SCHEMA>, generate the corresponding SQL command to retrieve the desired data, considering the query's syntax, semantics, and schema constraints.\n\n<SCHEMA>\nCREATE TABLE salesperson (salesperson_id INT, name TEXT, region TEXT); INSERT INTO salesperson (salesperson_id, name, region) VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 'North'), (2, 'Jane Smith', 'South'); CREATE TABLE timber_sales (sales_id INT, salesperson_id INT, volume REAL, sale_date DATE); INSERT INTO timber_sales (sales_id, salesperson_id, volume, sale_date) VALUES (1, 1, 120, '2021-01-01'), (2, 1, 150, '2021-02-01'), (3, 2, 180, '2021-01-01');\n</SCHEMA>\n\n<USER_QUERY>\nWhat is the total volume of timber sold by each salesperson, sorted by salesperson?\n</USER_QUERY>\n"}
{'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'SELECT salesperson_id, name, SUM(volume) as total_volume FROM timber_sales JOIN salesperson ON timber_sales.salesperson_id = salesperson.salesperson_id GROUP BY salesperson_id, name ORDER BY total_volume DESC;'}

```

## Fine-tune Gemma using TRL and the SFTTrainer

You are now ready to fine-tune your model. Hugging Face TRL [SFTTrainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/sft_trainer) makes it straightforward to supervise fine-tune open LLMs. The `SFTTrainer` is a subclass of the `Trainer` from the `transformers` library and supports all the same features, including logging, evaluation, and checkpointing, but adds additional quality of life features, including:

- Dataset formatting, including conversational and instruction formats 
- Training on completions only, ignoring prompts 
- Packing datasets for more efficient training 
- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) support including QloRA 
- Preparing the model and tokenizer for conversational fine-tuning (such as adding special tokens) 

The following code loads the Gemma model and tokenizer from Hugging Face and initializes the quantization configuration.

```
import torch
from transformers import AutoProcessor, AutoModelForMultimodalLM, BitsAndBytesConfig
from peft import prepare_model_for_kbit_training

# Hugging Face model id
model_id = "google/gemma-4-E2B" # @param ["google/gemma-4-E2B","google/gemma-4-E4B","google/gemma-4-12B","google/gemma-4-31B","google/gemma-4-26B-A4B"] {"allow-input":true}

# Check if GPU supports bfloat16
if torch.cuda.is_bf16_supported():
    torch_dtype = torch.bfloat16
else:
    torch_dtype = torch.float16

# Define model init arguments
model_kwargs = dict(
    dtype=torch_dtype, # What torch dtype to use
    device_map="auto", # Let torch decide how to load the model
)

# BitsAndBytesConfig: Enables 4-bit quantization to reduce model size/memory usage
model_kwargs["quantization_config"] = BitsAndBytesConfig(
    load_in_4bit=True,
    bnb_4bit_use_double_quant=True,
    bnb_4bit_quant_type='nf4',
    bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch_dtype,
    bnb_4bit_quant_storage=torch_dtype,
)

# Load model and processor
model = AutoModelForMultimodalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, **model_kwargs)
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("google/gemma-4-E2B-it") # Load the Instruction Processor to use the official Gemma template

# NOTE: You should call the prepare_model_for_kbit_training() function to preprocess the quantized model for training.
# On T4, we are skipping this step purely due to VRAM limitation and for a quick demonstration.
if (torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0).total_memory/1024**3) > 16:
    model = prepare_model_for_kbit_training(model)

```

```

```

The `SFTTrainer` supports a built-in integration with `peft`, which makes it straightforward to efficiently tune LLMs using QLoRA. You only need to create a `LoraConfig` and provide it to the trainer.

```
from peft import LoraConfig

peft_config = LoraConfig(
    lora_alpha=16,
    lora_dropout=0.05,
    r=16,
    bias="none",
    # no target_modules — PEFT's Gemma 4 defaults scope to the LM layers
    task_type="CAUSAL_LM",
    modules_to_save=["lm_head", "embed_tokens"], # make sure to save the lm_head and embed_tokens as you train the special tokens
    ensure_weight_tying=True,
)

```

Before you can start your training, you need to define the hyperparameter you want to use in a `SFTConfig` instance.

```
import torch
from trl import SFTConfig

args = SFTConfig(
    output_dir="gemma-text-to-sql",         # directory to save and repository id

    per_device_train_batch_size=1,          # batch size per device during training
    per_device_eval_batch_size=1,           # batch size per device during evaluation

    bf16=True if torch_dtype == torch.bfloat16 else False, # use bfloat16 precision
    lr_scheduler_type="constant",           # use constant learning rate scheduler
    push_to_hub=True,                       # push model to hub
    report_to="tensorboard",                # report metrics to tensorboard
    dataset_kwargs={"skip_prepare_dataset": True}, # important for collator
    remove_unused_columns = False,                 # important for collator
)

def collate_fn(examples):
    texts = []

    for example in examples:
        full_text = processor.apply_chat_template(
            example["messages"], add_generation_prompt=False, tokenize=False
        )
        texts.append(full_text.strip())

    # Tokenize the texts and process the audios
    batch = processor(text=texts, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)

For standard models this is transparent (same math, lower memory) and no action is needed — you'll get the new default automatically on upgrade. If you use a custom model, check ahead of time that `loss_type='chunked_nll'` runs and yields the same loss as `'nll'`; if it doesn't, pin `loss_type='nll'` to keep the current behavior and please open an issue at https://github.com/huggingface/trl/issues so we can address the edge case.

```

You now have every building block you need to create your `SFTTrainer` to start the training of your model.

```
from trl import SFTTrainer

# Create Trainer object
trainer = SFTTrainer(
    model=model,
    args=args,
    train_dataset=dataset["train"],
    eval_dataset=dataset["test"],
    peft_config=peft_config,
    processing_class=processor,
    data_collator=collate_fn,
)

```

Start training by calling the `train()` method.

```
# Start training, the model will be automatically saved to the Hub and the output directory
trainer.train()

# Save the final model again to the Hugging Face Hub
trainer.save_model()

```

```

[transformers] The tokenizer has new PAD/BOS/EOS tokens that differ from the model config and generation config. The model config and generation config were aligned accordingly, being updated with the tokenizer's values. Updated tokens: {'eos_token_id': 1, 'bos_token_id': 2, 'pad_token_id': 0}.

```

```

```

Before you can test your model, make sure to free the memory.

```
# free the memory again
del model
del trainer
torch.cuda.empty_cache()

```

When using QLoRA, you only train adapters and not the full model. This means when saving the model during training you only save the adapter weights and not the full model. If you want to save the full model, which makes it easier to use with serving stacks like vLLM or TGI, you can merge the adapter weights into the model weights using the `merge_and_unload` method and then save the model with the `save_pretrained` method. This saves a default model, which can be used for inference.

```
from transformers import AutoModelForMultimodalLM, AutoProcessor
from peft import PeftModel

# Load Model base model
model = AutoModelForMultimodalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, low_cpu_mem_usage=True)

# Merge LoRA and base model and save
peft_model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(model, args.output_dir)
merged_model = peft_model.merge_and_unload()
merged_model.save_pretrained("merged_model", safe_serialization=True, max_shard_size="2GB")

processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("google/gemma-4-E2B-it")
processor.save_pretrained("merged_model")

```

## Test Model Inference and generate SQL queries

After the training is done, you'll want to evaluate and test your model. You can load different samples from the test dataset and evaluate the model on those samples.

```
from transformers import AutoModelForMultimodalLM, AutoProcessor

model_id = "merged_model"

# Load Model with PEFT adapter
model = AutoModelForMultimodalLM.from_pretrained(
  model_id,
  device_map="auto",
  dtype="auto",
)
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id)

```

```

Let's load a random sample from the test dataset and generate a SQL command.

```
from random import randint
import re
from transformers import pipeline, GenerationConfig, pipeline

config = GenerationConfig.from_pretrained(model_id)
config.max_new_tokens = 256
config.eos_token_id = [processor.tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids("<turn|>")]

# Load the model and tokenizer into the pipeline
pipe = pipeline("text-generation", model=model, tokenizer=processor.tokenizer)

# Load a random sample from the test dataset
rand_idx = randint(0, len(dataset["test"]))
test_sample = dataset["test"][rand_idx]

# Convert as test example into a prompt with the Gemma template
prompt = processor.tokenizer.apply_chat_template(test_sample["messages"][:2], tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True)
print(prompt)

# Generate our SQL query.
outputs = pipe(text_inputs=prompt, generation_config=config)

<bos><|turn>system
You are a text to SQL query translator. Users will ask you questions in English and you will generate a SQL query based on the provided SCHEMA.<turn|>
<|turn>user
Given the <USER_QUERY> and the <SCHEMA>, generate the corresponding SQL command to retrieve the desired data, considering the query's syntax, semantics, and schema constraints.

<SCHEMA>
CREATE TABLE Auto_Shows (id INT, show_name VARCHAR(255), show_year INT, location VARCHAR(255)); INSERT INTO Auto_Shows (id, show_name, show_year, location) VALUES (1, 'New York International Auto Show', 2019, 'United States'); INSERT INTO Auto_Shows (id, show_name, show_year, location) VALUES (2, 'Chicago Auto Show', 2019, 'United States'); INSERT INTO Auto_Shows (id, show_name, show_year, location) VALUES (3, 'North American International Auto Show', 2018, 'United States');
</SCHEMA>

<USER_QUERY>
How many auto shows were held in the United States in the year 2019?
</USER_QUERY><turn|>
<|turn>model

Context:
 CREATE TABLE Auto_Shows (id INT, show_name VARCHAR(255), show_year INT, location VARCHAR(255)); INSERT INTO Auto_Shows (id, show_name, show_year, location) VALUES (1, 'New York International Auto Show', 2019, 'United States'); INSERT INTO Auto_Shows (id, show_name, show_year, location) VALUES (2, 'Chicago Auto Show', 2019, 'United States'); INSERT INTO Auto_Shows (id, show_name, show_year, location) VALUES (3, 'North American International Auto Show', 2018, 'United States');
Query:
 How many auto shows were held in the United States in the year 2019?
Original Answer:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Auto_Shows WHERE show_year = 2019 AND location = 'United States';
Generated Answer:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Auto_Shows WHERE location = 'United States' AND show_year = 2019;

```
